# bootstrap fashion
## a webpage for an online fashion magazine, based on one of the most popular global fashion brand's websites

I made this page for one of The Odin Project's HTML/CSS module tasks, focused on learning how to use the CSS framework Bootstrap.

The original task was to duplicate a news website, however I had done quite a lot of similar tasks with similarly-styled web pages recently, so decided to create a different type of website. There are similarities to the original task in terms of the elements and styles used on the news website and the fashion website, but this gave me a chance to explore different layouts.

### learnings

Overall I feel as though this project has deepened my understanding of Bootstrap and responsive design, and I would feel confident using Bootstrap in future. I also feel as though I have a good understanding as to when you would and wouldn't use Bootstrap.

For a simple and functional website where minimal customisation is needed, Bootstrap would be useful in reducing the time needed to create an attractive and responsive website. However, for a more customised/designed website, Bootstrap may not be the best choice. For the more designed aspects of the website, I found myself using lots of margin/padding workarounds, which can cause issues when resizing the webpage.

I would also like to create the website dynamically creating elements using JS or JSReact, I felt I could be more efficient using JS rather than adding elements and classes manually. However, as this is part of the HTML/CSS module, that was out of scope of this exercise.

### known issues

- For the purposes of the exercise I did not install Bootstrap and instead used jsDelivr. I also haven't used SASS, which is something I will learn in future.
- As this is part of the HTML/CSS course I haven't used any custom JS, which would no doubt improve the page.
- Sizing/positioning/spacing is not as neat/consistent as I would like, because I tried to use Bootstrap presets as much as possible as opposed to customising everything.
