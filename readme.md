# Bootstrap Fashion
### A homepage for an online fashion magazine, based on one of the most popular global fashion brands.

## About

I developed this page for [The Odin Project HTML/CSS module Project: Using Bootstrap](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/html-and-css/lessons/using-bootstrap). The purpose of this was to practice using Bootstrap. 

TOP's task was to duplicate a news website, however I'd done a lot of this recently with other projects, so I decided to find a different type of website to replicate (with similar features and elements to the website in the original brief). This gave me a chance to explore different layouts, styles and typography.

### Key Learnings

This project has really deepened my understanding of Bootstrap and responsive design. I am confident using Bootstrap in future.

I also feel like I understand which projects would and wouldn't benefit from Bootstrap. For a simple and functional website with minimal-moderate customisation, Bootstrap would be very useful in reducing the time needed to create an attractive and responsive website. For a more customised or design-focused site, Bootstrap may not be the best choice.

In this project to create the more bespoke aspects of the website, I found myself using some workarounds with Bootstrap classes. While I am pleased with the overall effect, this could cause some issues with responsive design.

If I were to re-do this website, I may not use Bootstrap, or I may just use it for some components (e.g. the nav) and customise the rest. I would also explore creating the website dynamically using JS as I feel this could be more efficient rather than adding lots of HTML elements manually. However, as this is part of the HTML/CSS module, that was out of scope of this exercise.

## Prerequisites & Installation

No special requirements [as I used jsDelivr rather than downloading Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/). 

## Licence

## Roadmap

* More pages to be added
    * Page for article 'topic' that you reach by clicking one of the Nav links, or sections in the main body (e.g. 'News);
    * 1-2 example article pages.

### Known Issues

* Sizing, positioning and spacing is not as consistent as I would like because I used Bootstrap classes as much as possible rather than customising everything.
* Where I have customised, I expect this could have been more organised and concise using a pre-processor such as SASS.
